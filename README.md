# Text Wordle Clone

This project was done as part of the final exam assignment for the six week online course *Python for Beginners* offered through openSAP.com and taught by instructors Christian Drumm and Stephan Jacobs from April 5 to June 1, 2022. The '5_letter_words.txt' file, [link here](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html), is where the target words for the project were found.
