    "#Final: Wordle in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task for the final assignment is to implement a Wordle clone in Python. The basis for your version of Wordle is the \n",
    "file '5_letter_words.txt' (https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html). It contains more than 5.700 five letter words. In order to build your version of Wordle perform the \n",
    "following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1.  Implement a function 'word_list()' that reads the '5_letter_words.txt' file and returns a list of the words in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2.  Implement a function 'random_word()' that takes a list of words as a parameter and returns a random word from this list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  3.  Implement a function 'is_real_word()' that takes two parameters, a guess and a word list and returns True if the word is \n",
    "      in the word list and False otherwise.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  4.  Implement a function 'check_guess()'that takes two parameters. The first is the guessed word and the second is the word \n",
    "      the user has to find. 'check_guess()'returns a string containing the following characters:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        * 'X' for each character in the guess that is at the correct position.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        * 'O' for each character in the guess that is in the word but not at the correct position.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        * '_' for each character in the guess that is not part of the word. For example, 'check_guess(\"birds\", \"words\")' should\n",
    "          return '__XXX'.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        * If a letter is used twice in the guessed word and exists only once in the word to be found, then only one letter in \n",
    "        the return string is marked. In case one of the two letters is positioned correctly, then this letter is marked with an\n",
    "        'X' in the return string. For example, 'check_guess(\"carat\", \"train\")' should return '_OO_O'. Another example, \n",
    "        'check_guess(\"taunt\", \"train\")' should return 'XO_O_'.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  5.  Implement a function 'next_guess()' that takes a word list as a parameter. The function asks the user for a guess, \n",
    "      converts the guess to lower case and checks if the guess is in the word list. If this is the case, the guess is returned. \n",
    "      Otherwise, the function asks the user for another guess.\n",
    "        \n",
    "  6.  Implement a function 'play()' that:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        * Uses the functions 'word_list' and 'random_word' to select a random 5 letter word.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        * Asks the user for a guess using the 'next_guess' function.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        * Checks each guess using the 'check_guess' function and shows the result to the user.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        * Checks if the users guessed the right word with six guesses or less. If yes, the user wins and the function prints \n",
    "          'You won!'. Otherwise the user loses and the function prints 'You lost!' as well as 'The word was:' followed by word \n",
    "          the user had to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example execution of the program:\n",
